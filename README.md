Today, I'm thrilled to share my project analyzing customer trends and engagement through credit card transactions. This project leverages the power of a data automation pipeline:

ðŸ“… Excel: I meticulously formatted the data for seamless analysis.

ðŸ”§ SQL: Streamlined data import from the formatted dataset, ensuring efficient and scalable reporting. (Bonus: This step can be bypassed if preferred!)

ðŸ“Š Power BI: The magic happens here! I built an interactive dashboard visualizing key metrics:
    > Revenue generated per transaction
    > Interest earned
    > Weekly percentage change (critical for weekly reports)
    > Card activation rates within a timeframe (including late fees for missed deadlines)
    > Customer segmentation by demographics (education, age, income, marital status) to reveal revenue patterns.

By automating the data pipeline with SQL, I've unlocked the ability to generate these reports "on autopilot," saving time and ensuring consistency.
